# Data_Structures_Algorithm_Roadmap

What is the most precious thing today? Data definitely makes it to one of the top positions. With such large amounts of data, it is necessary to derive efficient ways to organize, to save time and memory. This is where Data Structures and Algorithms come into play.

Ever played with Legos and seen how they build a structure up and up by joining little blocks? In the tech universe, Legos are replaced by Data structures. Known as building blocks for any application, Data Structures and Algorithms are one of the fundamental essentials in the world of technology.

Moreover, product-based companies like Facebook and Google, which have users spread worldwide, have astronomical amounts of data that need to be operated on in the most optimal manner possible. This efficient organization of data requires programmers who are skilled in the usage of Data Structures and Algorithms.
